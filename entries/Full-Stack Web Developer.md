# Full-Stack Web Developer

A **full-stack web developer** is a professional who can build both the **front-end (client-side)** and **back-end (server-side)** of a web application.

## What Does "Full-Stack" Mean?

- **Front-End**: The part users interact with, built with:

  - HTML (structure)

  - CSS (styling)

  - JavaScript (interactivity)

  - Frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular

- **Back-End**: The server, database, and application logic, using:

  - Languages like Python, JavaScript (Node.js), PHP, Ruby, or Java

  - Frameworks like Django, Flask, Express, or Rails

  - Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB

- **Other Skills**:

  - Git and version control

  - RESTful APIs or GraphQL

  - Basic DevOps (deployment, hosting)

  - Understanding of security and performance

## Why It Matter

Full-stack developers can create complete web apps from scratch, making them versatile in startups, agencies, or freelance work.
